# Workshop - App Runtime Task 1

## Tasks

* Here you would need to write a query and define some parameters

```js
const query = {
    results: {
        // @TODO: Writa a query to show 5 indicators with their name and description
    },
}
```
* Finally, you would need to use that query defined above to render your data ðŸ‘‡

```js
export const IndicatorsList = () => {
    // @TODO: Replace this line with a hook to perform the above query!
    const { loading, error, data } = { loading: false, error: 'Unimplemented', data: undefined }
}
```
## Solution:

* After you've completed these tasks, your application should look like this:
